## üß† How It Works

The backtester uses the Black-Scholes pricing model to calculate option premiums and simulates strategy performance over historical data. Key components include:

1. **Strategy Templates**: Pre-defined templates for all 14 options strategies
2. **Backtesting Engine**: Processes historical data and calculates P&L for each trade
3. **Risk Metrics**: Calculates Sharpe ratio, max drawdown, and other risk metrics
4. **Visualization Engine**: Creates interactive charts using Plotly

### Data Sources

The application uses yfinance to fetch real historical stock data, including:
- Open, High, Low, Close prices
- Trading volume
- Options chain data for implied volatility

## üìà Performance Analysis

The dashboard provides comprehensive performance analysis including:

- **Cumulative Returns**: Track strategy performance over time
- **Risk Metrics**: Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown, and volatility
- **Trade Statistics**: Win rate, average profit/loss per trade
- **Distribution Analysis**: P&L distribution histograms
- **Time-Based Analysis**: Monthly and day-of-week performance
